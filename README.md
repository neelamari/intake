# NodeJS REST API CRUD Example deployed in IBM Bluemix.

# Uses cloud foundry deployment model.

# Connects to an external mongodb service provided by Compose (app.compose.io) 

# When deployed first time, Compose mongodb service will not bind automatically.  

#Service needs to be added manually by logging to bluemix console. Once added cf push will bind this, alternatively can restage.
